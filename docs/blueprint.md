## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(187, 65%, 41%) – A vibrant cyan (#2DB2D4) to convey accuracy and reliability, with a modern feel.
- Background color: HSL(187, 15%, 95%) – Light, desaturated cyan (#F0F9FA) to provide a clean, non-distracting backdrop.
- Accent color: HSL(157, 55%, 44%) – A contrasting and lively spring green (#4AC78E) for highlighting key interactive elements.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for its neutral and modern legibility. Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, for a modern techy feel.
- Use clear, minimalist icons to represent actions like uploading, scanning, editing, and exporting data.
- A clean, well-spaced layout with a prominent display of the image and structured data table side-by-side for easy comparison and editing.
- Subtle animations to indicate processing and validation states (e.g., loading spinners, highlighting successful field validations).
